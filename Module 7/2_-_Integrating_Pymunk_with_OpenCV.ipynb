    "\n",
    "1. [DYNAMIC](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/pymunk.html#pymunk.Body.DYNAMIC) (Default type); These bodies react to collisions, are affected by forces and gravity, and have a finite amount of mass. These are the type of bodies that you want the physics engine to simulate for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [KINEMATIC](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/pymunk.html#pymunk.Body.KINEMATIC); These are bodies that are controlled from your code instead of inside the physics engine. They aren't affected by gravity and they have an infinite amount of mass so they don't react to collisions or forces with other bodies. Kinematic bodies are controlled by setting their velocity, which will cause them to move. Good examples of kinematic bodies might include things like moving platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [STATIC](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/pymunk.html#pymunk.Body.STATIC); These are the bodies that never (or rarely) move. Using static bodies for things like terrain offers a big performance boost over other body types- because Pymunk doesn't need to check for collisions between static objects and it never needs to update their collision information. Additionally, because static bodies don't move, Pymunk knows it's safe to let objects that are touching or joined to them fall asleep."
